# Modified Version of Repo [mapnes](https://github.com/ciciplusplus/mapnes)

## Modifications

Some modifications based on original project:

- Replace Google Map API with [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) so that Google API key is not needed
- Remove dependency of mapnik
- Use Leaflet [TileLayer](https://leafletjs.com/examples/map-panes/) instead local shapefiles serving labels and other layers
- Add cycling routes in Japan just for own interest

## More!

please refer to the awesome original repo for more tile styles and the [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vcPnk-6saw) video for the NES demo.
